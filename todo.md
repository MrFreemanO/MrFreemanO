## Todo List

### Phase 2: Analyze the trading strategy's strengths and weaknesses
- [x] Read through the translated report and identify key aspects of the strategy.
- [x] Categorize each aspect as a strength or weakness.
- [x] For each weakness, brainstorm potential improvements or solutions.
- [x] Summarize the overall strengths and weaknesses of the strategy.

### Phase 2: Enhance core bot modules (Scout, Executor, Exit) with advanced algorithms
- [x] Refactor ScoutModule to incorporate Dynamic Viability Scoring (DVS) with a placeholder for ML model integration.
- [x] Implement enhanced wash trading detection (e.g., Benford's Law simulation).
- [x] Add liquidity depth assessment to ScoutModule.
- [x] Refactor ExecutorModule for multi-RPC redundancy and failover logic.
- [x] Implement dynamic gas management (placeholder for real-time prediction).
- [x] Implement advanced slippage control and micro-execution (placeholder for TWAP/VWAP).
- [x] Refactor ExitModule for dynamic trailing stop parameters (volatility-adjusted, profit-tiered).
- [x] Implement multi-trigger activation (time-based, volume-based placeholders).
- [x] Implement partial exits and scaling out logic.

### Phase 3: Integrate with real-time data sources and exchange APIs
- [x] Integrate WebSocket connections for real-time data.
- [x] Integrate with PancakeSwap API for direct interaction.
- [x] Implement data normalization layer.
- [x] Implement data aggregation from multiple providers (0x, Bitquery, CoinGecko, DexScreener).
- [x] Add real-time price monitoring and slippage control.
- [x] Implement caching mechanisms for performance optimization.
- [x] Add health monitoring and failover logic for data providers.
- [x] Create mock data providers for demonstration and testing.
- [x] Implement ML-inspired viability scoring with multiple features.
- [x] Add trade signal generation based on comprehensive analysis.
- [x] Implement real-time position monitoring and exit logic.

### Phase 4: Develop User Interface and Reporting Features
