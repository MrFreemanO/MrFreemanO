# Detailed Requirements for Trading Bot Development

This document outlines the detailed requirements for the further development of the "Autonomous Speculator" trading bot, focusing on enhancing core modules, integrating real-time data, developing a user interface, implementing reporting features, and ensuring production readiness.

## Phase 1: Define Detailed Requirements for New Features

### 1.1. Core Bot Modules Enhancement

#### 1.1.1. Scout Module Improvements
*   **Dynamic Viability Scoring (DVS):** Transition from a rule-based scoring system to a more sophisticated, data-driven model. This could involve:
    *   **Machine Learning Integration:** Explore using a simple classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) trained on historical data of legitimate vs. scam tokens. Features would include: holder concentration, liquidity lock percentage, GoPlus security flags, transaction patterns (e.g., Benford's Law adherence), and potentially off-chain data like social sentiment or project team reputation (if feasible to automate collection).
    *   **Adaptive Weighting:** The model should dynamically adjust the importance of different features based on their predictive power, rather than fixed weights.
    *   **Confidence Score Output:** The DVS should output a probability score (0-1) indicating the likelihood of a token being legitimate and viable, allowing for more nuanced decision-making.
*   **Enhanced Wash Trading Detection:** Implement more advanced statistical methods and behavioral analysis to identify and filter out wash trading activities. This includes:
    *   **Benford's Law Application:** Systematically apply Benford's Law to transaction sizes for anomaly detection.
    *   **Clustering Analysis:** Identify clusters of wallets exhibiting coordinated, non-organic buying or selling patterns.
*   **Liquidity Depth Analysis:** Before recommending a trade, the Scout module should actively assess the real-time liquidity depth of the token on PancakeSwap to ensure that the intended trade size can be executed without excessive slippage. This goes beyond just checking for the existence of an LP.

#### 1.1.2. Executor Module Improvements
*   **Multi-RPC Redundancy and Failover:** Implement robust logic to connect to and seamlessly switch between multiple private RPC providers (e.g., BlockSec, Merkle, PancakeSwap Private RPC). The system should automatically detect RPC failures or high latency and switch to a healthy alternative.
*   **Dynamic Gas Management:** Implement an intelligent gas price strategy that:
    *   **Predicts Optimal Gas:** Uses external APIs or on-chain data to predict optimal gas prices to avoid overpaying while ensuring timely transaction inclusion.
    *   **Adapts to Congestion:** Dynamically adjusts gas limits and prices based on real-time network congestion and the urgency of the trade.
*   **Advanced Slippage Control and Micro-Execution:**
    *   **Reduced Slippage Tolerance:** Aim for significantly lower slippage tolerance (e.g., 1-3%) by breaking down larger orders into smaller, micro-executions.
    *   **Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) / Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Execution:** For larger positions, explore executing trades over a short period using TWAP/VWAP-like strategies to minimize market impact and slippage.

#### 1.1.3. Exit Module Improvements
*   **Dynamic Trailing Stop Parameters:** The trailing percentage for the Trailing Stop Order (TSO) should not be fixed. Instead, it should dynamically adjust based on:
    *   **Volatility-Adjusted Trailing:** Real-time volatility of the token (higher volatility = wider trail, lower volatility = tighter trail).
    *   **Profit-Tiered Trailing:** Different trailing percentages based on the accumulated profit (e.g., wider trail for initial profits, tighter trail once significant gains are locked in).
*   **Multi-Trigger Activation:** In addition to profit-based activation, consider:
    *   **Time-Based Activation:** Activating the TSO after a certain time period, even if the profit threshold hasn't been met, to protect against prolonged sideways movement.
    *   **Volume-Based Activation:** A sudden surge in selling volume (even if price is still rising) could trigger a partial or full exit.
*   **Partial Exits and Scaling Out:** Implement logic for partial exits (e.g., sell 50% at the initial TSO activation trigger, and trail the remaining 50% more aggressively) to lock in profits while still participating in further upside.

### 1.2. Real-time Data Integration and Exchange APIs
*   **WebSocket Integration:** Utilize WebSocket connections for real-time price feeds, liquidity pool changes, and new token listings to minimize latency.
*   **Exchange API Integration:** Integrate with PancakeSwap's API (or relevant BSC DEX APIs) for direct interaction, order placement, and order book data.
*   **Data Normalization:** Implement a data normalization layer to handle different data formats from various sources (on-chain, off-chain, APIs).

### 1.3. User Interface (UI) and Reporting Features
*   **Web-Based Dashboard:** Develop a simple, intuitive web-based dashboard for monitoring the bot's activity.
    *   **Key Metrics Display:** Real-time display of current P&L, open positions, token viability scores, gas prices, RPC latency, and system health.
    *   **Trade History:** A searchable and filterable log of all executed trades, including entry/exit prices, P&L, and reasons for entry/exit.
    *   **Alerts and Notifications:** Display real-time alerts for critical events (e.g., failed transactions, significant price deviations, RPC outages, potential scam indicators).
*   **Reporting:**
    *   **Daily/Weekly Performance Reports:** Generate automated reports summarizing bot performance (total P&L, win rate, average trade duration, etc.).
    *   **Post-Mortem Analysis:** Detailed reports for individual trades, especially those with significant P&L, to facilitate learning and optimization.

### 1.4. Production Readiness
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling mechanisms with graceful degradation and retry logic for network issues, API failures, and blockchain errors.
*   **Logging:** Implement structured logging (e.g., using Python's `logging` module with JSON format) for all bot activities, including data ingestion, decision-making, trade execution, and errors. Log levels should be configurable (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
*   **Configuration Management:** Externalize all configurable parameters (e.g., API keys, RPC endpoints, strategy parameters, thresholds) into a separate configuration file (e.g., YAML, JSON, or environment variables) to allow for easy modification without code changes.
*   **Deployment Strategy:** Define a clear deployment strategy (e.g., Docker containers for isolated environments, cloud deployment on AWS/GCP/Azure) to ensure reliable and scalable operation.
*   **Security:** Implement best practices for securing API keys, private keys, and sensitive data (e.g., environment variables, secret management services).
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Beyond the UI, integrate with external monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and alerting services (e.g., PagerDuty, Slack, email) for proactive notification of critical issues.
*   **Automated Failsafes:** Implement automated shutdown or pause mechanisms if certain critical thresholds are breached (e.g., excessive drawdown, repeated failed transactions, prolonged RPC outages).

## Phase 2: Enhance core bot modules (Scout, Executor, Exit) with advanced algorithms

This phase will involve implementing the detailed requirements outlined in Section 1.1. for the Scout, Executor, and Exit modules. This will include refactoring existing code and adding new functionalities to incorporate machine learning, dynamic parameter adjustments, and advanced execution strategies.

## Phase 3: Integrate with real-time data sources and exchange APIs

This phase will focus on establishing robust, low-latency connections to real-time data sources and exchange APIs as detailed in Section 1.2. This will involve using WebSocket connections and integrating with relevant DEX APIs for live market data and direct trading capabilities.

## Phase 4: Develop User Interface and Reporting Features

This phase will involve building the web-based dashboard and implementing the reporting functionalities as described in Section 1.3. This will likely involve using a web framework (e.g., Flask for the backend, React/Vue.js for the frontend) and a database for storing historical trade data and logs.

## Phase 5: Implement Production Readiness (Error Handling, Logging, Deployment)

This phase will focus on making the bot production-ready by implementing the requirements outlined in Section 1.4. This includes comprehensive error handling, structured logging, externalized configuration, and defining a deployment strategy.

## Phase 6: Conduct comprehensive testing and validation

This phase will involve rigorous testing of all implemented features, including unit tests, integration tests, and extensive simulation in the mainnet forking environment. Performance benchmarking and stress testing will also be conducted.

## Phase 7: Document and deliver the finalized trading bot

This final phase will involve creating comprehensive documentation for the bot, including setup instructions, usage guides, API references, and maintenance procedures. The finalized bot and its documentation will then be delivered to the user.
